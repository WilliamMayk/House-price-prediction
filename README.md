# House-Price-Prediction

# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and other relevant attributes. The dataset used for training and evaluation is stored in 1553768847-housing.csv.
 
# Dataset

- **File:** housing.csv
- **Description:** Contains housing market data, including features that influence house prices.
- **Attributes:** Location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, lot size, year built, and price.
